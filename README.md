# Heyo! 👋
## I'm Caleb, a Senior at the University of Michigan. I like architecting code 📐 and stuff that runs on the cloud 🌥  
Unfortunately, most of my schoolwork and work as an intern has to be in private repos, but you can check out my contribution history :octocat:  
[Check me out on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/CalebJ-Smith) while you're at it.  


I'm actively looking for a full-time position after graduating in May of 2024, so if this got you interested, DM me on LinkedIn and we can talk.
