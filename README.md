# Heyo! 👋
## I'm Caleb. I write code to solve problems 📐 It's fun.
Unfortunately, most of my work has to be in private repos 🙁  
Might as well [check me out on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/CalebJ-Smith) while you're here

#### Some of my current interests
- Building things that do stuff
  - Classic, I know 🤷‍♂️
  - Even better if it actually works
- Distributed systems
- Using tools that tech blogs have convinced me was cool
  - Kafka, Redis, chaos engineering. Kind of an extension of "Distributed systems"
- Concurrent programming
- Compile-time safety without duplicate keystrokes
- Actually using Markdown when available 
- Problem spaces where performance matters at least a little bit
- Exploring functional programming and other programming paradigms
  - TODO: learn lisp
