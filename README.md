# Heyo! 👋
## I'm Caleb, a Junior at the University of Michigan. I like architecting code 📐 and stuff that runs on the cloud 🌥  
Unfortunately, most of my schoolwork and work as an intern has to be in private repos, but you can check out my contribution history :octocat:  
[Check me out on LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/CalebJ-Smith) while you're at it.  
- I played with Rust 🦀 a lot this summer and really enjoyed it
- Golang intriques me, so I'm planning on playing with it publicly here in the next little bit and getting some kind of web server up and running in a containerized environment

I'm actively looking for an internship for Summer 2023, so if this got you interested, DM me on LinkedIn and we can talk
